                 <h1>BARÇA 1, ATLETI 0, AKA “ATLETI GOT ATLETI’D”</h1>
                 <p>Even after having watched it, it was bewildering. It was Messi. A team played crap for 85 minutes, then its talisman came on and everything changed</P>

                 <h1>ANDRE GOMES AND ‘FAILURE’</h1>
                 <p>Alba is, on form, the best LB in the world right now, at both ends of the pitch, from assists to defensive interventions. Rakitic and Paulinho did exactly what they were supposed to, as both had excellent matches, the former in a key spot as he subbed for a wounded Busquets</P>

                 <h1>BARÇA 3, CHELSEA 0, AKA “MASTER AND COMMANDER”</h1>
                 <p>Shortly after taking part in that thread, I got to thinking about sporting passion, the nature of fandom, and what prevents us from just enjoying something for exactly what it </P>

                 <h1>UMTITI AND THE VALUE OF A DEFENDER</h1>
                 <p>When natural phenomena occur, from something as rote yet amazing as a sunrise, to meteors and volcanoes, people try to explain them with science, try to know the unknowable, rather than just standing back and saying, “Holy shit. Looka that..</P>

                 <h1>FAILURE, CONTEXT AND HOW DID WE GET HERE?</h1>
                 <P>Suddenly Barca wasn’t losing fights for the ball. But the biggest difference was playing space. Messi was surrounded as Sevilla was determined to not let Messi beat them. And he did anyway.</p>
