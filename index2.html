                 <h1>Cristiano Ronaldo scores ANOTHER stunning bicycle kick for Real MadridE’</h1>
                 <p>Practice makes perfect ... Cristiano Ronaldo showed his stunning strike for Real Madrid against Juventus was no fluke by replicating it days later in training.</P>

                 <h1>Madrid derby will be scintillating precisely because there is little to play for”</h1>
                 <p>The Madrid derby is rarely short of side narratives, but perhaps the most interesting aspect of this one -- the 161st La Liga meeting between the sides -- is that it really doesn't matter much on paper. </P>

                 <P>Florentino Perez's desire to acquire Karim Benzema was so great that he travelled to Bron Terraillon himself in 2009 to convince the striker to sign with Real Madrid from Lyon</p>

                 <h1>Dani Carvajal 9/10, Cristiano Ronaldo 7/10 in draw with rivals Atletico Madrid</h1>
                 <p>The game was referred to as the "Decaf Derby" in the Spanish press given the low stakes of the game and they had a point. Aside from a spell in the second half, there was very little intensity during the affair and it was all very sportin</P>
